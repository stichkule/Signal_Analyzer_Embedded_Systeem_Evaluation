# Signal_Analyzer_Embedded_Systeem_Evaluation
This project report is intended to serve as a high level design and analysis document, for the design evaluation of a Signal Analyzer. Based on the design and performance requirements desired by the client, simulations and tests were carried out using an evaluation board with the aid of external hardware and software components. Using these test results, which are listed as project deliverables, the suitability of the STM32F401RE microcontroller for the Signal Analyzer application was evaluated, along with providing recommendations pertaining to full system design and performance.
